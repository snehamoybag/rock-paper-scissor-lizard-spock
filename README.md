## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM naming conventions
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](vitejs.dev) - Vite Package bundler
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) - For better css organisations

### What I learned

A great challenge that made me brush off my animations and layout skills a little more.
Game logic itself is very simple and easy to build. However, the layout and animations are some different gravy!
Wanted to add some movements with some animations, and boy.. ended up making my life way harder than it should've been.
Took me few trials and errors to get things right, well atleaset the way I wanted. For now, I am happy with the results!

### Continued development

As of now, I've only done the 'Rock, Paper and Scissors' part of the challenge, but I've left everything setup for the bonus challenge.
Will definitely finish in near future.

## Acknowledgments

Although I've coded everything from scratch, the animations styles are heavily inspired by our fellow FEM member [lieneil](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/rock-paper-scissor-lizard-spock-OqBM3Ujnf7). Huge Shoutout to [lieneil](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/NJVS) !!
